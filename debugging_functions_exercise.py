"""
In this file, there are several functions with related purposes. The functions
each have both a documentation string in them, and also contain a bug in the
code. The bugs are of of different complexity. Your task is to identify the
bugs and fix them.

Rules:
1. The function documentation strings should not be changed, as they are
correct in describing what the function is supposed to do. Instead, you should
fix the code to make the function work as described in the documentation string.

2. You should not change the function names, as they are used in the tests.

3. You should not change the number of arguments the functions take, as they
are also required for tests.

Grading of this assignment is based on the number of bugs you find and fix.
There is at least one bug in each function, but there may be more. The bugs
can be of different types.

It can be helpful to try and call the functions from the python console to see
what they return, and to try and understand what the bug might be.

INTRO TO REQUESTS:
The last function utilises the requests-library. The requests-library is a
library that allows you to send HTTP requests.

HTTP requests (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) are the way communication over
the internet functions. The requests library in Python allows us to send HTTP
requests and get responses.

You can try putting the url
'https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?from=GBP&to=USD'
to your browser address bar to see the response. The requests library allows us
to do this in Python, without rendering the page in a browser. You could
simplify this by saying that you can use the internet through a command line
or through code with ease, using simple HTTP requests.

The Frankfurter API is a simple API that returnscurrency exchange rates in the
form of a JSON. A JSON is a data format that is easy to work with in Python.
It is similar to a dictionary, with key-value pairs.

An example of such a JSON response from the currency-exchange API is given below:

>>> import requests
>>> response = requests.get('https://api.frankfurter.app/latest?from=GBP&to=USD')
>>> response.json()
{
  "amount": 1,
  "base": "GBP",
  "date": "2024-06-10",
  "rates": {
    "USD": 1.2719
  }
}
